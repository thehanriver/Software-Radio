# Software-Radio
Me and me teammate couldn't utilize USRP B210 kit to make our software radio so we used GNU radio and the blocks.
In doing so, we had two parts, Matlab and GNU radio part.
Matlab is implementing QPSK modulation for a functional transmitter. 
The GNU radio part is implementation of a functional reciever and transmitter.
Again, we would use USRP B210s to actually transmit signals but we used the chanel model instead.
More info is provided in the team reports.
